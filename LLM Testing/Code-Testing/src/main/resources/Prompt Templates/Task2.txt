The instructions for Task 2 are below marked between a pair of "///":
///
Now that the system supports creating profiles, it is time to manage those profiles. This will include loading, unloading, and deleting profiles as explained below.

Loading Profiles
The LOAD_PROFILE command loads a profile into the system. This command requires exactly one argument, representing the username to be loaded. Again, the user might type the username in any case, but the system will always process it in title case.

A success message occurs when the profile is found and successfully loaded:

Profile loaded for <USERNAME>.
If the profile is not found, then the following message gets printed:

No profile found for <USERNAME>. Profile not loaded.
When a profile is successfully loaded, the PRINT_DB command should print an extra *** in front of the currently-loaded profile. For example, if the database has three profiles, and the second profile is successfully loaded, then the PRINT_DB command should print the following:

Database has 3 profiles:
 1: Jordan, 21
*** 2: Jenny, 25
 3: John, 30

Hint: See the MessageCli.PRINT_DB_PROFILE_HEADER_SHORT message template.

While a profile is loaded, the LOAD_PROFILE command could be executed again. The new load will only succeed if the profile is found (as a usual load), otherwise it fails with the usual error when a username cannot be loaded. In this case, the currently-loaded profile remains loaded.

If the new load succeeds, the system will unload the currently-loaded profile, and load the new profile. For example, if the database has three profiles, and the second profile is successfully loaded, and then the third profile is successfully loaded, then the PRINT_DB command should print the following:

Database has 3 profiles:
 1: Jordan, 21
 2: Jenny, 25
*** 3: John, 30
While a profile is loaded, the CREATE_PROFILE command should not be allowed. If the user tries to create a profile while a profile is already loaded, then the following message should be printed:

Cannot create a new profile. First unload the profile for <CURRENT_LOADED_PROFILE_USERNAME>.
Creating a new profile can go ahead, only after the currently-loaded profile is unloaded (see below).

Unloading Profiles
The UNLOAD_PROFILE command unloads the currently-loaded profile. This command requires no arguments.

When a profile is successfully unloaded, the following message should be printed:

Profile unloaded for <USERNAME>.
If there is no currently-loaded profile, then the following message should be printed:

No profile is currently loaded.

Deleting Profiles
The DELETE_PROFILE command deletes a profile from the database. This command requires exactly one argument, representing the username to be deleted.

When a profile is successfully deleted, the following message should be printed:

Profile deleted for <USERNAME>.
When a profile is successfully deleted, this means it will no longer exist in the database.

If the profile is not found, then the following message gets printed:

No profile found for <USERNAME>. No profile was deleted.
If the profile is currently loaded, then the deletion should not go ahead and the following message gets printed:

Cannot delete profile for <USERNAME> while loaded. No profile was deleted.
The loaded profile must be unloaded before it can be deleted.

It is however perfectly fine to delete a profile that is not currently loaded, as long as it exists in the database.
