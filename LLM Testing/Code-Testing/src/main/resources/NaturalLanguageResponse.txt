These errors occur when the \"ClientProfile\" class is referenced as a type or when its methods are called.\n\nTo fix these errors, the code needs to ensure that the \"ClientProfile\" class is properly imported and accessible within the \"InsuranceSystem\" class. This can be done by either adding the import statement for the \"ClientProfile\" class or by ensuring that the \"ClientProfile\" class is in the same package as the \"InsuranceSystem\" class."      },      "finish_reason": "stop"    }  ],  "usage": {    "prompt_tokens": 2104,    "completion_tokens": 203,    "total_tokens": 2307  }}
