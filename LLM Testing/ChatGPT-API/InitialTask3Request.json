Time to create some insurance policies! Our insurance system will support three types of policies: car, home, and life.\n\nEach of these policies require various bits of information (which we can refer to as “options”). These are as follows:\n\nHome Policy\nSum insured (how much to insure for, which is always an integer)\nAddress (where the home is located, which is always a String)\nRental (whether the home is rented out, which is always a boolean)\nThe base premium (how much the client must pay) for a home policy is calculated as follows:\n\nIf the home is rented out, then the base premium is 2% of the sum insured.\nIf the home is not rented out, then the base premium is 1% of the sum insured.\nCar Policy\nSum insured (how much to insure for, which is always an integer)\nMake and model (the make and model of the car, which is always a String)\nLicense plate (the license plate of the car, which is always a String)\nMechanical breakdown (whether the car is to be covered for mechanical breakdown, which is always a boolean)\nThe base premium for a car policy is calculated as follows:\n\nIf the client is under 25 years old, then the base premium is 15% of the sum insured.\nIf the client is 25 years old or older, then the base premium is 10% of the sum insured.\nIf the car is to be covered for mechanical breakdown, then the base premium is increased by a further $80 (regardless of age).\nLife Policy\nSum insured (how much to insure for, which is always an integer)\nThe base premium for a life policy is calculated as (1 + age/100)% of the sum-insured. For example, someone who is 25 years old would pay 1.25% of the sum insured, and someone who is 30 years old would pay 1.30% of the sum insured.\n\nThere are two more restrictions regarding life policies:\n\nFirstly, the maximum age for a life policy is 100 years old. The error message would be:\n\n<USERNAME> is over the age limit. No policy was created.\nSecondly, there can only be at most one life policy per client profile. The error message would be:\n\n<USERNAME> already has a life policy. No new policy was created.\nDiscounts\nThe system is able to apply discounts to the base premium of a policy. The discounts are as follows:\n\nIf the client has exactly two policies, then the total premium is reduced by 10% (calculated against the sum of the base premiums).\nIf the client has three or more policies, then the total premium is reduced by 20% (calculated against the sum of the base premiums).\n\nWe create new policies using the POLICY_HOME, POLICY_CAR, and POLICY_LIFE commands. A newly-created policy is always assigned as a policy for the currently-loaded profile. If there is no currently-loaded profile, then the policy creation should not go ahead and the following message should be printed:\n\nNeed to load a profile in order to create a policy.\n\nThese three commands actually operate slightly different from the other commands we have seen. While they do not require any arguments, they still require the user to provide the additional information (the options above). These options will be prompted for by the system one at a time.\n\nFor example, if the user executed the POLICY_HOME command, then the system will prompt the user for the following options:\n\ninsurance system> policy-home\n        Sum to insure: 1000000\n        Property address: 20 Symonds Street\n        Rental? (yes/no): yes\n\nCollecting these options is handled for you. Once collected, they are placed into an array of strings (i.e., the String[] options parameter in the InsuranceSystem.createPolicy() method).\n\nFor the example above, the options array would contain the following:\n\noptions[0] = \"1000000\"\noptions[1] = \"20 Symonds Street\"\noptions[2] = \"yes\"\nYou do not need to handle the situation of invalid options (e.g., if the user enters a non-integer for the sum insured). We will always use valid option types for marking.\n\nNote that different policies will have a different number of options. For example, the POLICY_CAR command will have 4 options, the POLICY_HOME command (example above) will have 3 options, and the POLICY_LIFE command will have 1 option.\n\nWhen successfully creating a policy, the following message should be printed:\n\nNew <TYPE> policy created for <USERNAME>.\nwhere <TYPE> is the type of policy being created (i.e., car, home, or life), and <USERNAME> is the username of the currently-loaded profile.\n\nHint: When you run the program interactively to create a new policy, the system will still prompt for the policy details even if there is no currently-loaded profile. This is fine, as that is the way that the testing framework is set up (to collate all the input in one place before passing it on to the respective method in the InsuranceSystem.java file). Here’s an example of a perfectly valid interaction with the system:\n\ninsurance system> policy-home\n        Sum to insure: 1000000\n        Property address: 20 Symonds Street\n        Rental? (yes/no): yes\nNeed to load a profile in order to create a policy.\ninsurance system> load-profile jordan\nProfile loaded for Jordan.\ninsurance system> policy-home\n        Sum to insure: 1000000\n        Property address: 20 Symonds Street\n        Rental? (yes/no): yes\nNew home policy created for Jordan.\n\nPrinting Policy Details\nAfter you have policies added into the client profiles, the PRINT_DB command should print out the details of the policies as well. There are a few things to note here.\n\nWhen listing the profiles, you should add in their header how many policies they have. Pay attention to the pluralisation of the word “policy” (i.e., “0 policies” versus “1 policy” versus “2 policies”)\n\n 1: Jordan, 21, 1 policy\n 2: Tom, 25, 3 policies\n 3: Jenny, 23, 0 policies\n\nHint: See the MessageCli.PRINT_DB_PROFILE_HEADER_MEDIUM message template.\n\nThe details of the policies should also be displayed in the PRINT_DB command.\n\nThe policies within a profile should be printed out in the order that they were created.\n\nThe information printed about each policy is as follows:\n\nHome Policy\nHome Policy (<ADDRESS>, Sum Insured: $<SUM_INSURED>, Premium: $<BASE_PREMIUM> -> $<DISCOUNTED_PREMIUM>)\nFor example, Jenny’s home policy for a rental insured for $1,000,000, without any discounts:\n\nHome Policy (20 Symonds Street, Sum Insured: $1000000, Premium: $20000 -> $20000)\nCar Policy\nCar Policy (<MAKE_AND_MODEL>, Sum Insured: $<SUM_INSURED>, Premium: $<BASE_PREMIUM> -> $<DISCOUNTED_PREMIUM>)\nFor example, Tom’s car policy for a Subaru Impreza insured for $55,000, with mechanical breakdown coverage, and without any discounts:\n\nCar Policy (Subaru Impreza, Sum Insured: $55000, Premium: $5580 -> $5580)\nLife Policy\nLife Policy (Sum Insured: $<SUM_INSURED>, Premium: $<BASE_PREMIUM> -> $<DISCOUNTED_PREMIUM>)\nFor example, Jordan’s life policy insured for $80,000, without any discounts:\n\nLife Policy (Sum Insured: $80000, Premium: $968 -> $968)\n\nPrinting the total to pay\nThe PRINT_DB command needs to also print out the total premium to pay for all the policies for every profile. The total premium is calculated as the sum of the discounted premiums of all the policies for the profile.\n\nFor example, if Jenny has no policies, Jordan has one policy for $500, and Tom has two policies discounted to $180 and $90, then the output will look like this:\n\n1: Jenny, 25, 0 policies for a total of $0\n2: Jordan, 21, 1 policy for a total of $500\n   ... Premium: $500 -> $500)\n3: Tom, 25, 2 policies for a total of $270\n   ... Premium: $200 -> $180)\n   ... Premium: $100 -> $90)\n\nHint: See the MessageCli.PRINT_DB_PROFILE_HEADER_LONG message template.\n///\n\nPlease code the HomePolicy, LifePolicy, and CarPolicy Java classes according to these prior
