This will include loading, unloading, and deleting profiles as explained below.\n\nLoading Profiles\nThe LOAD_PROFILE command loads a profile into the system. This command requires exactly one argument, representing the username to be loaded. Again, the user might type the username in any case, but the system will always process it in title case.\n\nA success message occurs when the profile is found and successfully loaded:\n\nProfile loaded for <USERNAME>.\nIf the profile is not found, then the following message gets printed:\n\nNo profile found for <USERNAME>. Profile not loaded.\nWhen a profile is successfully loaded, the PRINT_DB command should print an extra *** in front of the currently-loaded profile. For example, if the database has three profiles, and the second profile is successfully loaded, then the PRINT_DB command should print the following:\n\nDatabase has 3 profiles:\n 1: Jordan, 21\n*** 2: Jenny, 25\n 3: John, 30\n\nHint: See the MessageCli.PRINT_DB_PROFILE_HEADER_SHORT message template.\n\nWhile a profile is loaded, the LOAD_PROFILE command could be executed again. The new load will only succeed if the profile is found (as a usual load), otherwise it fails with the usual error when a username cannot be loaded. In this case, the currently-loaded profile remains loaded.\n\nIf the new load succeeds, the system will unload the currently-loaded profile, and load the new profile. For example, if the database has three profiles, and the second profile is successfully loaded, and then the third profile is successfully loaded, then the PRINT_DB command should print the following:\n\nDatabase has 3 profiles:\n 1: Jordan, 21\n 2: Jenny, 25\n*** 3: John, 30\nWhile a profile is loaded, the CREATE_PROFILE command should not be allowed. If the user tries to create a profile while a profile is already loaded, then the following message should be printed:\n\nCannot create a new profile. First unload the profile for <CURRENT_LOADED_PROFILE_USERNAME>.\nCreating a new profile can go ahead, only after the currently-loaded profile is unloaded (see below).\n\nUnloading Profiles\nThe UNLOAD_PROFILE command unloads the currently-loaded profile. This command requires no arguments.\n\nWhen a profile is successfully unloaded, the following message should be printed:\n\nProfile unloaded for <USERNAME>.\nIf there is no currently-loaded profile, then the following message should be printed:\n\nNo profile is currently loaded.\n\nDeleting Profiles\nThe DELETE_PROFILE command deletes a profile from the database. This command requires exactly one argument, representing the username to be deleted.\n\nWhen a profile is successfully deleted, the following message should be printed:\n\nProfile deleted for <USERNAME>.\nWhen a profile is successfully deleted, this means it will no longer exist in the database.\n\nIf the profile is not found, then the following message gets printed:\n\nNo profile found for <USERNAME>. No profile was deleted.\nIf the profile is currently loaded, then the deletion should not go ahead and the following message gets printed:\n\nCannot delete profile for <USERNAME> while loaded. No profile was deleted.\nThe loaded profile must be unloaded before it can be deleted.\n\nIt is however perfectly fine to delete a profile that is not currently loaded, as long as it exists in the database.\n///\n\nPlease fix the following code according to these instructions:\n\"\"\"\npackage nz.ac.auckland.se281;\n\nimport nz.ac.auckland.se281.Main.PolicyType;\n\npublic class InsuranceSystem {\n  public InsuranceSystem() {\n    // Only this constructor can be used (if you need to initialise fields).\n  }\n\n  public void printDatabase() {\n    // TODO: Complete this method.\n  }\n\n  public void createNewProfile(String userName, String age) {\n    // TODO: Complete this method.\n  }\n\n  public void loadProfile(String userName) {\n    // TODO: Complete this method.\n  }\n\n  public void unloadProfile() {\n    // TODO: Complete this method.\n  }\n\n  public void deleteProfile(String userName) {\n    // TODO: Complete this method.\n  }\n\n  public void createPolicy(PolicyType type, String[] options) {\n    // TODO: Complete this method.\n  }\n}\n\"\"\"\nHere are the test cases that must pass:\n\"\"\"\npackage nz.ac.auckland.se281;\n\nimport static nz.ac.auckland.se281.Main.Command.*;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.junit.runner.RunWith;\nimport org.junit.runners.Suite;\nimport org.junit.runners.Suite.SuiteClasses;\n\n@RunWith(Suite.class)\n@SuiteClasses({\n  MainTest.Task2.class, // Uncomment this line when to start Task 2\n  MainTest.Task3.class, // Uncomment this line when to start Task 3\n  // MainTest.YourTests.class, // Uncomment this line to run your own tests\n})\npublic class MainTest {\n\n  public static class Task2 extends CliTest {\n\n    public Task2() {\n      super(Main.class);\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void T2_xx_load_profile_found() throws Exception {\n      runCommands(\n          unpack( //\n              CREATE_SOME_CLIENTS, //\n              LOAD_PROFILE,\n              \"Tom\"));\n\n      assertContains(\"Profile loaded for Tom.\");\n      assertDoesNotContain(\"No profile found for Tom.
