This is the constructor for the BotDealer class:
"""
	public BotDealer(String name, List<Participant> players) {
		super(name);
		this.players = players;
	}
"""
Please fix the following code to add a bot dealer named "Dealer":
"""
	public BlackJack() {
		players = new ArrayList<>();
		dealer = null; // FIXME Task 2
		players.add(new HumanPlayer("Player1"));
		players.add(new BotPlayer("Bot1")); // Add Bot1
		players.add(new BotPlayer("Bot2")); // Add Bot2
	}
