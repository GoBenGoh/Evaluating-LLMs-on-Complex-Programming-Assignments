Please fix the following code such that the dealer is instantiated after the players are added to the ArrayList:
"""
public BlackJack() {
    players = new ArrayList<>();
    dealer = new BotDealer("Dealer", players); // Create a new BotDealer named "Dealer"
    players.add(new HumanPlayer("Player1"));
    players.add(new BotPlayer("Bot1")); // Add Bot1
    players.add(new BotPlayer("Bot2")); // Add Bot2
}
"""
